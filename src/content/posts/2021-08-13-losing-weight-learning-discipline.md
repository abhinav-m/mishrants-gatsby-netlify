**Warning Long post ahead**, scroll to the bottom for tldr:

Around January 2019 i was near 100 kgs (220 pounds) of weight. Looking back, i always felt lethargic , sluggish and my weight was also affecting my confidence. Around May 2019, i decided to change things.

I read up a lot about weight loss online and decided to fix my diet first (thanks reddit) and started exercising at home. Initially for the first month or so, I just cut off junk food from my diet. I still ate parathas (pan fried indian bread), and fried things at home, and consumed sugar regularly. I exercised for 20 mins everyday following a youtube video I found online. ( Link at bottom)I worked out early morning ( 7 am initially with the youtube videos)

After about 2 months or so i started to see results. I joined the gym around this time, and started going at 6 am in the morning. I had lost around 6 kgs of weight in this time period and i decided to take my diet and dedication to another level. I focused on cutting off homemade "bad" food first. I cut off parathas (pan fried indian bread), fried sabzi (vegatables) and started focusing more on macro nutrients. I still ate rotis (regular indian bread) and cut down rice to once a day. I ate a lot of daal (lentils and legumes) , rotis(regular indian bread) and vegetables during this period. I also started working out and going to the gym during this time period. I worked out for about 1.5 - 2 hours a day following the REDDIT PPL, and made my goal to get abs. I read up a lot online during this period and realized i was still not hitting macro nutrients such as protein and started counting my calorie intake regularly. I did abs twice a day ( once during the workout in the morning , once after coming home from office). To get more protein, i took up my only feasible option, egg whites! I detest the taste of boiled eggs. I remember almost puking when i ate one ( after mixing it in a sandwich and slathering it with sauces). I increased one egg to 2, 2 - 4 and at some point i started eating 8 eggs worth of egg whites (divided into 4 egg whites per meal twice a day)

After about 2 more months (4-5 months into exercising regularly) into the above diet i had lost around 12-15 kgs of weight. I was starting to plateau in my weight loss so i decided to up my game further. I started to eat a lot of daal (boiled lentils and legumes), vegetables and cut off rice completely. I also cut off sugar completely and added a protein shake to complete my macro goals. I added Paneer(cottage cheese) for some fat as it is needed and helped me fulfill my macros. I cut off roti (indian bread) to twice a day ( 2 roti (indian bread) per day). I started swallowing 16 eggs worth of egg whites per day to hit my protein goals ~160 g. I tracked regularly on MFP, a habit which i follow everyday

After about 7-8 months into this diet i cut off rotis completely. My abs were starting to show at this point. To fulfill every macro nutrient, i ate a lot of daal (lentils and legumes), chole (chickpeas), rajma (beans). To fulfill my carb goals, i ate toasted brown bread grilled paneer ( cottage cheese) sandwich, or a cup of rice per day. I drank protein shakes, paneer(cottage cheese) and dal(lentils) to fulfill my protein and fat goals. My exercise and hard work was paying off as i had finally crossed into normal BMI from overweight after a lot of hard work and discipline. I stopped working out abs twice a day as it got too much, but i replaced it with walking for 20 mins during my lunch breaks in office. I gobbled down 16 eggs worth of egg whites everyday.

For abs, I continued the same diet and restricted my total calorie intake further, and added more cardio to my workout routine. I also exercise my abs and core 6 days a week. Right now, my abs are not very well defined but they are starting to show up (15 percent bodyfat) My goal is to reach 12 percent before end of May ( that would mark 1 year) and get well defined abs. I do hanging leg raises ( progessed from supported to 12 X 3) , and weighted situps. I also do a video of athlean x on abs which is killer and is only 7 mins long!

I did slip off / went into maintainence unintentionally in between, and i heard about the advice of adding refeeds to your workout, but i really wanted abs so i pushed myself.

**My learning:**

From being joked about, to random people coming up to me in office, in my localityand my relatives telling me that i inspire them, it has been quite a journey. I never told anyone that I was working out, and the people closest to me didn't even notice when i lost around 10 kgs (20 pounds) of weight initially. Don't do things to impress anyone else. When people started noticing, they started complimenting me and telling me that i inspire them. Some people told me that i can't keep it up for life, i just shrugged those negative feedback off.

You do it with a goal in mind, and you do it for yourself. Nothing will get you farther than discipline. Sometimes you just need to push yourself and make it to the gym. I haven't missed a single day of workout when i was able to. If i couldn't make it to the gym for some reason, i would workout at home following a youtube video. If the gym was closed i would go for running. I did something everyday, and the only break I took was when i was unwell. Motivation is fickle, build discipline it will last you a lifetime. Also after a certain point, not going for a workout feels bad. You have to build up to that habit.

My advice: Start slow, and build a habit. Cut off the junk, you know what it is. Diet is 70% of the game, and exercise only 30. You don't need any special diet, just track what you eat, add portion control, and switch to healthier choices. Slowly get used to your new diet. Fitness is a marathon, not a race. Don't compare your progress to others, but keep a track of your progress. Measure your weight, the scale doesn't lie. Keep working on yourself and keep improving wherever you can, and you will see results soon. Everyone can do it.

Huge shoutout to the reddit [r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/) community. It has been my only resource. Youtube channels I watch JTS Juggernaut training system ,, alan thrall ( again heard about these from reddit ) for form.

Jeff Nippard/ Athlean X for general fitness stuff.

**My workout routine Reddit ppl with added exercises:**

**Pull**:Added assisted pullups to normal pullups, recently added 2x forearm exercises supersetted with each other to save time\*\*Push:**Added dips.Legs:Added leg extensions ( i dont remember this being in the ppl routine, correct me if im wrong) and farmers walk**Final Leg day:\*\*I start with a core/abs class at my gym (which lasts about an hour)

I added a bit of the glamour muscles to the last leg day with barbell curls, chinups, triceps extension, lat raises . This kills me by the end of my last leg day ( saturday)

On Sundays:I do limber 11 stretches and athlean x 7 mins abs. I run sometimes.

My lifts are pretty weak tbh, but i started from an empty bar or 10kgs and i am around : **60kg (\~120 pounds) bench 90kg (\~180 pounds) dl 55kg (\~110 pounds ) squat 45kg (\~90 pounds) ohp**

I do 10 mins of cardio AFTER my workout everyday.I added hanging leg raises, weighted situps to my workout ( initially i did athlean x 7 min abs twice a day at the gym and after work)On my last legs day , ie Saturday, I go for a body wrecking workout. My gym offers a group abs/core class which is brutal and lasts around an hour, after that i workout my legs as mentioned above (Final legs day)

What im doing due to the virus: Bodyweight stuff / pair of dumbles and reps until failure. Diet is a struggle now since im not going to work. Trying to get more equipment to workout at home!

I'm also doing HIIT (Insanity to be specific)
